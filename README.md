Attention!

1. MATDPA uses the dosimetry notation of the IVEM facility at Argonne National Laboratory. In the code, 1 count-per-second (cts) is equal to 6.25E+09 ions/cm2/s. Use this appropriate unit to convert your ion flux to cps and input in the MATLAB prompt after the SRIM calculation is finished.

2. The file TRIMAUTO should be always set to 1 as MATDPA is using TRIM on batch mode calculations. If TRIMAUTO is not 1, MATDPA will not work.
